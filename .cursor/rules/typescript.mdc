Rules for when building Javascript and/or Typescript projects:

- Use Typescript throughout the codebase, including for scripts executable from the command-line
- All constant strings, numbers etc should be constants and/or enums as appropriate and specified in a single place (constants.ts) and referenced throughout the codebaser from that place.
- All data structures should be strongly typed and all types and enums should be specified in a single place (types.ts) and referenced throughout the codebase from that place.
- Use Bun as the package manager, for installing global NPM modules, and for executing scripts
- Ensure Husky + conventional commits are setup with a package.json script to run the pre-commit step
- If the project is intending to publish an NPM library that is to be used by others then both ESM and CommonJS output targets are needed - setup tsconfig.json files and package.json script commands accordingly
