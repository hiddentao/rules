Instructions for using Biome as the linter and formatter include how it should be configured.

# General

- There should be a single biome.json in the root folder of the project (even if the project is a monorepo) that applies the globaly desired Biome rules to the codebase. If any sub-folders/sub-projects require specific rule changes then a biome.json can be created for those but still inheriting from this root biome.json
- The root package.json or equivalent file containg script commands should have both `lint` and `format` commands configured to run linting and formatting across the entire codebase.

# Typescript

- Allow the use of `any` keyword but as much as possible import/specify exact types. Create a types.d.ts, custom.d.ts, etc if necessary for global types.
- Omit semicolons where possible
- Prefer `for of` instead of `forEach`
